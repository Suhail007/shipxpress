Final Scope (Production-Ready Build) - Driver App [Dev] {Prod}
Goal: Deliver a fully functional, secure, and reliable cross-platform Driver App with all key workflows, validations, and safeguards. The app must handle real-world logistics operations across varied devices, networks, and use cases.

✅ Full Functional Scope (Beta + Final Enhancements)

🧑‍💼 Authentication & Profile
Full registration flow:


Upload: profile photo, ID proof, driving license


KYC stage: "Pending Approval", "Approved", "Rejected"


Secure login with session management


Logout + token expiry


Push notification permission prompt



📦 Order Management
Orders assigned from admin panel (via API)


Filters: All / Today / Upcoming / Completed / Failed


Multi-drop trip handling (UI + routing)


Basic delivery info:


Sender & receiver name


Package notes


Contact info with click-to-call


Order lifecycle:


Assigned → Picked → In-Transit → Delivered / Failed



🗺️ Navigation & Route Optimization
Google Maps integration with:


Single-stop and multi-drop pathing


Live ETA


Turn-by-turn external navigation (deep linking)


Auto-refresh routing if new order added



✅ Pickup/Drop Validation (Highly Configurable)
QR/Barcode scan to validate pickup/drop


OTP entry screen (numeric input with retry logic)


Upload proof photo (minimum 1 image mandatory)


Optional signature capture or e-sign pad


Fallbacks for failed scans or incorrect OTPs:


Manual override with admin permission


Comment box for edge cases



📋 Checklist & Delivery Completion
Mandatory delivery checklist (configurable via admin)


Final remarks (required for failed deliveries)


“Mark as Complete” triggers backend sync


Delivery submitted with:


Timestamp


Location


Status (Success, Failed, Reattempt Required)



📍 Live Location Sharing & Geo-Fencing
Background location sharing (every 10–30 sec)


Geo-fencing alerts:


Driver exits assigned zone → warning + alert to admin


Auto-flag route deviation in trip history


Map visible to admin panel + shipper (read-only)



🛠️ Support Features
Panic Button:


Driver triggers alert → admin notified with location + reason


In-App Chat:


Real-time secure messaging with admin panel


Auto-log of conversation in trip history


Offline Mode:


Caches order list & trip progress


Syncs automatically once back online


Queue system for photo uploads and validation retries



🔒 Security & Permissions
Root detection


Background location permission prompt


Device lock & trip freeze if KYC fails


Secure token with auto-logout on inactivity


End-to-end encryption (location, chat, media uploads)



📉 Performance Considerations
Low network handling (retry logic with backoff)


Compression of photos before upload


Error fallback screens (retry/skip/log)


App memory footprint < 150MB (target)


Performance-tested on low-end Android (2GB RAM) and iOS (iPhone 7+)



🧪 Edge Cases & Recovery Logic:
Scenario
App Behavior
QR/OTP invalid
Show error, allow manual entry/comment after 3 tries
No network
Cache locally, auto-sync when online
Driver skips delivery step
Alert, disallow trip completion
Location access denied
Block trip start, prompt user
App force-closed mid-trip
Resume last trip on next open
Photo upload fails
Retry option, local queue
Device is rooted
App lock screen with warning
Driver exits geofence
Alert + auto-log deviation
Admin changes assignment mid-trip
Notify driver + refresh UI


✅ Final Acceptance Criteria:
Driver completes a full pickup → delivery flow with:


Validation


Location tracking


Proof submission


Admin sees live location, delivery status, uploaded media


System handles:


Retry logic


Network failure


Manual fallbacks


Smooth UX on Android 10+ and iOS 14+


No crashes across 50+ test cases
